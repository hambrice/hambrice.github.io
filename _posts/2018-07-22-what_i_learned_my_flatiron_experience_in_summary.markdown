Now that I have graduated the program, as I reflect on the experience, it's flabbergasting to think that not even 8 months ago I knew virtually nothing about code. Prior to starting the bootcamp prep course for the program, the only exposure I had to programming was basic CSS/HTML while trying to make my Myspace as tacky as possible back in the day. It's been surreal to look back on how much I have learned in this short amount of time. 

Prior to starting the program, I remember reading an article on Thinkful that discussed the difficulties that can come with first learning code [located here](https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/). In particular, what stuck with me was a graph that was included that was to represent the learning experience. On the x-axis is compotence, and on the y-axis is![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/viking_education/web_development/blog/coding_is_hard_confidence_competence.png)
